1. Delivering functionalities

What I did: Delivered 2 major features —

Split OT functionality: handled complex scenarios where OT crossed midnight and needed splitting based on workday/weekoff.

Worked hours calculation: studied the entire logic for a week, documented it, and rewrote it into optimized, efficient code.


Impact: These features solved critical business problems, reduced errors, and made the product more accurate and reliable.

Impact: Improved team knowledge, ensured better code quality, and reduced bottlenecks by contributing as a full stack developer.

5. Improving the performance

What I did: Decoupled reporting logic from the main system by creating a separate microservice and optimized multiple areas for better response times.

Impact: Improved performance significantly, made reporting independent and more maintainable, and reduced load on core services.
