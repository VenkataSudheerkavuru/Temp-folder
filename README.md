For employees with attendance exception- no punch

current: the required hours and worked hours are 0:00:00

expectation: the required hours should follow the same logic as the present employees.

for example, shift 9-18, with 1 hours break 

case1: no leave, then required hours=8 

case2:  leave for half day, then required hours=4

case3: special request for 8 hours, then required hours=0

case 4, leave for 2 hours, then required hours=6

case5, holiday, then required hours=0
